# Get Instance Connection Name
To connect with the `cloud_sql_proxy`, you'll need the instance connection name for your GCP SQL instance.

Follow these step-by-step instructions to obtain the Instance Connection Name.

- At the left side, of the page hit the navigation slide in and click your already pinned `SQL` menu item.
- Click the link to the SQL instance you created earlier.
- Locate the `Instance connection name` field.  That string is the instance connection name.

You'll use this connection string when setting up the `cloud_sql_proxy` connection.
