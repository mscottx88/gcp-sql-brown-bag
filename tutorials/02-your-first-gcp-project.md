# Setup Your First GCP Project
Let's go through the exercise of setting up your first GCP Project!

**Note**
If you haven't done so already, visit and sign in to your project here https://console.cloud.google.com

- Click the drop-down with the label `My Project` at the top of the page.
- Click the `+` icon at the upper right corner of the popup.
- Give your new project a snazzy name.
  - **Note** If you can't think of anything, try `my-gcp-sql-project`.
- Click Create
  - **Note** Project creation is not instantaneous.  In the upper right, you should
  see a bell-shaped Notifications icon.  You can observe the progress of long-running
  tasks there.
- Once your project finishes creating, click that same `My Project` dropdown and
then click the link to your new project.

You should now see the dashboard to your first GCP Project!
